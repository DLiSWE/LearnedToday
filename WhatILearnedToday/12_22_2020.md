Todays objectives: Find CSS designs for
<li>Buttons</li>
<li>Conditioned text format</li>

What I learned:
When importing CSS from an external site, such as codepen.io, make sure
that you configure the CSS so that you can manipulate the attributes and use those attributes for designing elements that the prebuilt css code wasn't initially created for. In the Udemy Course, we see that we can manipulate a background KEYFRAMES spinify animation and adjust it so text is changed instead of background. Most of the CSS provided have additional code to display the example, so we have to get rid of those elements when we apply it.

Django Template Formatting:
There is a base.html and all other templates basically inherit specific widgets from the base. The base.html will need the starting 
```{% load staticfiles %}```
To link to static files in static_root folder

*You can use Django with Jinja. Pip install jinja2 and change settings in Django. This link solves this problem.

Future Test Cases:
<li> Combining prebuilt CSS snippets </li>
