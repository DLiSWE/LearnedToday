Todays objectives:
<ol>
<li>Find CSS designs for: Buttons, Text, Background</li>
<li>Conditioned text format</li>
<li>Complete Base Blog Project</li>
<li>Codewars</li>
</ol>
What I learned (Web/App Development):
<p>When importing CSS from an external site, such as codepen.io, make sure
that you configure the CSS so that you can manipulate the attributes and use those attributes for designing elements that the prebuilt css code wasn't initially created for.In the Udemy Course, we see that we can manipulate a background KEYFRAMES spinify animation and adjust it so text is changed instead of background. Most of the CSS provided have additional code to display the example, so we have to get rid of those elements when we apply it.

Django Template Formatting:
There is a base.html and all other templates basically inherit specific widgets from the base. The base.html will need the starting 

```html
{% load staticfiles %}
```

To link to static files in static_root folder. Other templates extend off the base html.

For conditional template designs(if/for/.etc)
Make sure there is an end tag {% if xxx.xxx %}<(somecode)>{% endif %}. For more details. *endif will end if block: Nothing goes after it
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/templates/language/#variables
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/templates/builtins/

*You can use Django with Jinja. Pip install jinja2 and change settings in Django. This link solves this problem.

<h3>Algorithms</h3>
Find domain name for URL:
using replace() method of the static beginnings of the url in the front *critical thinking question*
Recursion Algorithm:
This Works!

```python
def funky(num, list1=[]):
    while num > 0:   
        if num % 2 == 1:
            list1.insert(0,1)
            return funky(num//2)
        elif num % 2 == 0:
            list1.insert(0,0)
            return funky(num//2)
        elif num == 1:
            list1.insert(0,1)
            continue
        elif num == 0:
            list1.insert(0,0)
            continue
        else:
            print('somethings wrong')
print(funky(15))
```

Things to note:
<li>Putting a default list in parameters will allow you to create a list you can iterate results onto when dealing with recursion.</li>

Future Test Cases:
<li> Combining prebuilt CSS snippets </li>

<h3>What I learned today:</h3>
<p>The Opposite of Big O is the Omega Notation. Its used to measure the best case scenario.
The Theta Notation is used to measure both best and worst case scenarios</p>
<br />
<p>4 Pillars of Software Engineering -> Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism </p>
This is more less about coding and more about understanding how SWE's think.

Inheritance:
Basis of OOP.
Parents and children.
Ability to 'inherit' another class's methods or functions

Encapsulation:
Wrapping data and methods within class.
Functions and methods within classes defined by private variables (not python, however for developers purposes, we use _varname) defines whether they are within the scope of the function. **name manging**

Polymorphism:
After inheriting, we can modify the function/method taken from the parent and reimplement it for the child class. This is known as **Method Overriding**

Abstraction:
More often seen in javascript
<p>
Abstraction can be thought of as a user using a function and getting the result, but all the details of how the function works are "private".
This can also be thought as taking a prebuilt method or object and accessing a specific component in the method/object. We don't necessarily need to know exactly how it's done, but as long as we can implement it, it's OK-ish.
This can be seen with my experience with complex CSS animations. I don't know how to animate text but I can take a code snippet from someone who does and implement it.
</p>

*Compare current and next value using nested for loop and while loop*
```python
#for
def compare(n):
    count = 1
    for i in n:
        for x in n[count:]:
            if i > x:
                count+=1
                return i
#while
def compare1(n):
    count = 0
    count1 = 1
    while count < len(n):
        if n[count] > n[count1]:
            count += 1
            count1 += 1
        if count == len(n)-1:
            break
```

Rendering a form as paragraph, table, list

Combining CSS and Bootstrap on Button:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26640250/using-bootstrap-and-my-own-css-together

When inputting a variable in Django template, put the object name and property you want to inject inside double curly brackets

```html
<p>Posted by: {{comment.author}} </p>

```

**Remember the differences between {% condition function %} and {{placeholder}}**

A lot of changes happen in between versions of Django. Ones I remember right now are:

```python
url(r'', views.view.as_view())
#becomes
re_path(r'', views.view.as_view())
#without raw string find uses path() still

views.login
#becomes
views.LoginView.as_view()
#changed from functional view to class based view
```

<br>
<link href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.2.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
<style>
.mycustombtn{
  background: #000;}
</style>  
<button type="button" class="btn btn-danger mycustombtn">Danger</button>
```

Trunchate characters to display shorted result from view.

```html
<p>{{post.text|trunchatechars:200}}</p>
```

<h3>Algorithms and Data Structure Vocab:</h3>
<h4>Various Techniques of Algorithms:</h4>

<li>Recursive Algorithm: Simple problems are broken into smaller or simple problems and useful solutions are found.</li>
<li>Divide and Conquer Algorithm: The problem is split into smaller subproblems of identical form. After solving it, it is combined to make a solution for the main problem.</li>
<li>Greedy Algorithm: Solves problems by taking optimal solutions without considering any consequences of result at a small level, with the hope to seek out solutions for giant problems.</li>
<li>Dynamic Programming Algorithm: Past outcome is considered to discover new results.</li>
<li>Brute Force Algorithm: Tries all possibilities until the desired result is not achieved </li>
<li>Backtracking algorithm: Sub problems, solution is locate out for each sub problem until you don’t reach for Holocaust for main problem</li>
<li>Randomized Algorithm: Uses a random number to construct a decision.</li>
<br>
<h4>Data Structure Types<h4>
Data Structure: Types of Data Structure:

<li>Arrays</li>
Lists, Tuples, Sets
<li>Linked Lists</li>
Singly, Doubly, Circular
<li>Stacks</li>
Last In First Out(LIFO),
First in Last Out(FILO),
<li>Queues</li>
First In First Out(FIFO),
Last In Last Out(LILO),
<li>Hash Tables</li>
Pretty much Dictionaries(map(), dictionary comprehension)
<li>Trees</li>
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-bfs-and-dfs/ <br>
Tree Traveral, Depth First, Breadth First. ( Several connected Doubly linked lists). <br>
Leafs of child 'nodes' without a pointer to another node. Root could be thought as parent node. <br>
Look more in details about depth and breadth first:<br>
**Depth First is Faster**<br>
Depth First Traversal search uses the stack data structure. It traverses 'down' until it cant, goes back to the last node that has another vertice and moves 'down' form there.<br>
Breadth First Traversal search uses the heap data structure. Return order follows inheritance hierarchy, the parent being on top<br>

<li>Heaps</li>
For python, to create a heap, we need to: 

```python
import heapq
```

-to heavify a list. Heaps allow us to access values in a array/list in a constant time.

<li>Graphs</li>
Kind of similar to Trees (Non-linear data structures). but instead of node classes with pointers, we directly state which
parent/vertice(head) is connected to which parent/vertice (also known as edges(technically pointers)) by creating a graph dictionary such as:

```python
graph = { 
   "a" : ["b","c"],
   "b" : ["a", "d"],
   "c" : ["a", "d"],
   "d" : ["e"],
   "e" : ["d"]
}
# Print the graph 		 
print(graph)
# Define distinct edges

def findedges(self):
    edgename = []
    for vrtx in self.gdict:
        for nxtvrtx in self.gdict[vrtx]:
        if {nxtvrtx, vrtx} not in edgename:
            edgename.append({vrtx, nxtvrtx})
    return edgename
```
Graphs are good to show relationships between vertices. We can picture social media friends and mutual friends web. Users are vertices and their relationships with other users are edges. There are directed graphs where the edges have an orientation(pointer direction). The opposite is undirected and graphs can also be mixed. Look Up Adjacency matrix to further comprehension on interactions between vertices. A lot more complicated than how i explained.** BFS and DFS are also applied here for traversal.**
