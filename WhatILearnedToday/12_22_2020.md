<ol>
<li>Find CSS designs for: Buttons, Text, Background</li>
<li>Conditioned text format</li>
<li>Complete Base Blog Project</li>
<li>Codewars</li>
</ol>
What I learned (Web/App Development):
<p>When importing CSS from an external site, such as codepen.io, make sure
that you configure the CSS so that you can manipulate the attributes and use those attributes for designing elements that the prebuilt css code wasn't initially created for.In the Udemy Course, we see that we can manipulate a background KEYFRAMES spinify animation and adjust it so text is changed instead of background. Most of the CSS provided have additional code to display the example, so we have to get rid of those elements when we apply it.
</p>
<br />

Django Template Formatting:
There is a base.html and all other templates basically inherit specific widgets from the base. The base.html will need the starting 

```html
{% load staticfiles %}
```

To link to static files in static_root folder. Other templates extend off the base html.

For conditional template designs(if/for/.etc)
Make sure there is an end tag {% if xxx.xxx %}<(somecode)>{% endif %}. For more details. *endif will end if block: Nothing goes after it
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/templates/language/#variables
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/templates/builtins/

*You can use Django with Jinja. Pip install jinja2 and change settings in Django. This link solves this problem.

<h3>Algorithms</h3>
Find domain name for URL:
using replace() method of the static beginnings of the url in the front *critical thinking question*<br><br><br>
Recursion Algorithm:<br>
This Works!<br>

```python
def funky(num, list1=[]):
    while num > 0:   
        if num % 2 == 1:
            list1.insert(0,1)
            return funky(num//2)
        elif num % 2 == 0:
            list1.insert(0,0)
            return funky(num//2)
        elif num == 1:
            list1.insert(0,1)
            continue
        elif num == 0:
            list1.insert(0,0)
            continue
        else:
            print('somethings wrong')
print(funky(15))
```

Things to note:
<li>Putting a default list in parameters will allow you to create a list you can iterate results onto when dealing with recursion.</li>

<h3>What I learned today:</h3>
<p>The Opposite of Big O is the Omega Notation. Its used to measure the best case scenario.
The Theta Notation is used to measure both best and worst case scenarios</p>
<br />
<p>4 Pillars of Software Engineering -> Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism </p>
This is more less about coding and more about understanding how SWE's think.

Inheritance:<br>
Basis of OOP.<br>
Parents and children.<br>
Ability to 'inherit' another class's methods or functions<br>

Encapsulation:<br>
Wrapping data and methods within class.
Functions and methods within classes defined by private variables (not python, however for developers purposes, we use _varname) defines whether they are within the scope of the function. **name manging**
<br>
Polymorphism:<br>
After inheriting, we can modify the function/method taken from the parent and reimplement it for the child class. This is known as **Method Overriding**
<br>
Abstraction:<br>
More often seen in javascript<br>
<p>
Abstraction can be thought of as a user using a function and getting the result, but all the details of how the function works are "private".
This can also be thought as taking a prebuilt method or object and accessing a specific component in the method/object. We don't necessarily need to know exactly how it's done, but as long as we can implement it, it's OK-ish.
This can be seen with my experience with complex CSS animations. I don't know how to animate text but I can take a code snippet from someone who does and implement it.

*Compare current and next value using nested for loop and while loop*
```python
#for
def compare(n):
    count = 1
    for i in n:
        for x in n[count:]:
            if i > x:
                count+=1
                return i
#while
def compare1(n):
    count = 0
    count1 = 1
    while count < len(n):
        if n[count] > n[count1]:
            count += 1
            count1 += 1
        if count == len(n)-1:
            break
```

A lot of changes happen in between versions of Django. Ones I remember right now are:

```python
url(r'', views.view.as_view())
#becomes
re_path(r'', views.view.as_view())
#without raw string find uses path() still

views.login
#becomes
views.LoginView.as_view()
#changed from functional view to class based view

<h3>Algorithms and Data Structure Vocab:</h3>
<h4>Various Techniques of Algorithms:</h4>

<li>Recursive Algorithm: Simple problems are broken into smaller or simple problems and useful solutions are found.</li>
<li>Divide and Conquer Algorithm: The problem is split into smaller subproblems of identical form. After solving it, it is combined to make a solution for the main problem.</li>
<li>Greedy Algorithm: Solves problems by taking optimal solutions without considering any consequences of result at a small level, with the hope to seek out solutions for giant problems.</li>
<li>Dynamic Programming Algorithm: Past outcome is considered to discover new results.</li>
<li>Brute Force Algorithm: Tries all possibilities until the desired result is not achieved </li>
<li>Backtracking algorithm: Sub problems, solution is locate out for each sub problem until you don’t reach for Holocaust for main problem</li>
<li>Randomized Algorithm: Uses a random number to construct a decision.</li>
<br>
<h4>Data Structure Types<h4>
Data Structure: Types of Data Structure:

<li>Arrays</li>
Lists, Tuples, Sets
<li>Linked Lists</li>
Singly, Doubly, Circular
<li>Stacks</li>
Last In First Out(LIFO),
First in Last Out(FILO),
<li>Queues</li>
First In First Out(FIFO),
Last In Last Out(LILO),
<li>Hash Tables</li>
Pretty much Dictionaries(map(), dictionary comprehension)
<li>Trees</li>
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-bfs-and-dfs/ <br>
Tree Traveral, Depth First, Breadth First. ( Several connected Doubly linked lists). <br>
Leafs of child 'nodes' without a pointer to another node. Root could be thought as parent node. <br>
Look more in details about depth and breadth first:<br>
**Depth First is Faster**<br>
Depth First Traversal search uses the stack data structure. It traverses 'down' until it cant, goes back to the last node that has another vertice and moves 'down' form there.<br>
Breadth First Traversal search uses the heap data structure. Return order follows inheritance hierarchy, the parent being on top<br>

<li>Heaps</li>
For python, to create a heap, we need to: 

```python
import heapq
```

-to heavify a list. Heaps allow us to access values in a array/list in a constant time.

<li>Graphs</li>
Kind of similar to Trees (Non-linear data structures). but instead of node classes with pointers, we directly state which
parent/vertice(head) is connected to which parent/vertice (also known as edges(technically pointers)) by creating a graph dictionary such as:

```python
graph = { 
   "a" : ["b","c"],
   "b" : ["a", "d"],
   "c" : ["a", "d"],
   "d" : ["e"],
   "e" : ["d"]
}
# Print the graph 		 
print(graph)
# Define distinct edges

def findedges(self):
    edgename = []
    for vrtx in self.gdict:
        for nxtvrtx in self.gdict[vrtx]:
        if {nxtvrtx, vrtx} not in edgename:
            edgename.append({vrtx, nxtvrtx})
    return edgename
```
Graphs are good to show relationships between vertices. We can picture social media friends and mutual friends web. Users are vertices and their relationships with other users are edges. There are directed graphs where the edges have an orientation(pointer direction). The opposite is undirected and graphs can also be mixed. Look Up Adjacency matrix to further comprehension on interactions between vertices. A lot more complicated than how i explained.** BFS and DFS are also applied here for traversal.**

<h3>What I learned:</h3>
Default parameters:<br>
Setting a default parameter allows for that parameter to be an optional input.

```python

class Node:
    #assuming there will always be an input for data parameter
    def __init__(self,data,next_node=None)
        self.data = data
        self.next_node = next_node

    new_node = Node(43)
    
    #new_node Will produce only 43 but can also accept another parameter next_node if it connects to anything
```
question: does Node(None) === None?<br>
Answer: No. The object that is being created each time with Node(None) is different each time therefore they are not exactly equivalent.
<br>

**Oh by the way, in Javascript and other languages that use === for checking more indepth equivalence, Python's alternative is 'is' (object identity). It behaves differently for strings but when checking other things, it goes more in depth than '=='.**
<br>
Check: https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html for details.


```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=None, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

if Node(None) is None:
    print(True)
else:
    print(False)

```

<br>

Python's None is actually an object. Other languages (Java/Javascript/C++) null or their alternatives of None are primitive data types.
*Memory Allocation:*
<br><br>

Primitive types are stored in the stack memory. Whenever an object is created, the values or state of the object is stored in the heap memory and the pointer to the object(object state/property values) is stored in the stack memory.
Python doesn't really have to deal with memory reallocation because of a feature called **Garbage Collection** which frees up memory if needed.

**DICTIONARIES CAN ACCEPT ANY DATA TYPES AS KEY**
Dictionaries act as hash maps, which allow python users to use nodes as keys.

How robust is your scheduling/booking application? Is there an external application<br> employees use to check on it? How do employees know if they have an appointment?<br>
What days do your employees work? Do they work during Holidays/Weekends/Days-off?<br>
How many employees do you have?<br>
Can I talk to the person currently managing your website? What do they do with the scheduling? How is it implemented in their business? <br>
How do you confirm appointments? Who on your end will be handling that? Do you take appointments in real life and add it onto your schedule online? If so, how frequent?<br>
What do they get when they subscribe? How is your current subscription list being saved and used?<br>
How does your chat now function work? Who is responding? Is this person always available?<br> Do you want to continue using a similar chat system to what your current website is?<br>
Do you need to store previous appointment/client names? Up until when?<br>
Do employees have special access to something on the site?<br>
Do you have an admin page on your current website? If you do, what is on it?<br>

Serializers in Django REST API:<br>
Translates python models to other datatypes.<br>
Serializers is basically JSON translations from and between frontend and backend.
We have seen this and created our own serializer(health app) before by just iterating through JSON packs like its a dictionary.<br>
Question: Do we need to serialize and deserialize everything that is going to the frontend?<br>
AKA serialize forms, serialize db models, etc. When and why would we need it? Serializing forms found with the django_rest_api module that we have to install to our base django app to connect to something like React.<br>
Django has built in connectors, psycopg2 is one of them.<br>
Django.utils.text import slugify:<br>
Slugify will make URLs that have spaces or characters usually cant be in the URL a underscore. Django's utils have several useful tools. Resources for django utils found here:<br> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/utils/ <br>
When using generic views, make sure the attributes you created in the models exist in the generics. We can create our own but for beginner purposes we can study these to learn.Honestly there is a lot of documentation on django but not many situational documentation on the little things that you have to figure out yourself by looking at different projects and recreating those unique aspects.

Django Deployment On Heroku:
Reference:https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/deployment/checklist/
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-python

Django has a built in method in manage.py check --deploy to identify settings that should be changed for deployment:
Make sure you hide secret key in setting.py(import a key from separate file),
**DISABLE DEBUG**, prevents end users from seeing development procs and source code, etc. Make sure your allowed _hosts = [] include the webserver provided by Heroku or whatever web service youre using. Im pretty sure this is given once you create your project on the Heroku platform. Make sure static_root contains static files on the project(images,css)/i'm not sure what staticcollect does but I'm pretty sure I have to do it. Make sure all forms in django html templates have CSRF_tokens. After settings, create a requirement.txt file which will let heroku know which modules to install onto server. This can be created by pip freezing >> requirement.txt the venv?. Heroku has add-ons where u can add heroku's postgres plan. Make sure your databases are migrated onto heroku after setting up. Not sure what to do from here in regards to database setting. I've only been hosting postgres locally, so i'm not too familiar hosting db's remotely, i'mma look more into that. 
reference:https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql
A bunch of setting configurations on Heroku...not exactly sure what gunicorn is, will look into it.

Step 3: Deploy

<h4>What I learned today:<h4>

WD:


DS and A:

Python/OOP:
@classmethod lets us access the class instead of the __init__. We can use a @classmethod so set an attribute in the class. We can do this from an instance as well but thats less used.

```python
class Employee:
    raise_amount = 1.03
    def __init__(self,first,last, pay)
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.pay = pay

    @classmethod

Depth first is recursion
breadth first goes by level

call stack. after the function ends, the last recursion in the call stack is popped out. So after you hit the last condition, you go back to the parent/root of the leaf.

Algorithm Designs:
Bubble Sort: Quadratic Big O, algorithm that works by iterating through a list and checking whether the current element is greater than or less than the next element. Nested for loop.

**Swapping Variables**
Create Temp variables to hold values in iterations to swap.

Merge Sort:
Divide and conquer algorithm. 2 parts. Splittng original list into smaller sorted lists recursively until there is only 1 element in list. Then merging back the presorted 1 element lists into 2 element lists, 4, and so on recursively

```python
def merge_sort(lst):
  if len(lst) <= 1:
    return lst
  middle = len(lst) // 2
  left = lst[:middle]
  right = lst[middle:]
  sleft = merge_sort(left)
  sright = merge_sort(right)
  return merge(sleft, sright)
 
def merge(left, right):
  result = []
  while (left and right):
    if left[0] < right[0]:
      result.append(left[0])
      left.pop(0)
    else:
      result.append(right[0])
      right.pop(0)
  if left:
    result += left
  if right:
    result += right
  return result
  
  ```

The ol' swaparoo

```python

def swap(arr, index_1, index_2):
    nums = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]
    temp = arr[index_1]
    arr[index_1] = arr[index_2]
    arr[index_2] = temp

```

**The frequency of an element can be retrieved by dividing the a % n’th element by n.**

You can add tuples to stack to create a key-pair type data

Don't limit yourself when coding by trying to do as little as possible. Sometimes it's better to have a separate utility function to help find something specific.

Binary search Tree: Everything of the left subtree is less than head and everything on the right subtree is greater than head...recursively

return booleans by testing against another boolean

```python

return (True and False) # False
return (True or False) # True
return (True and (True and False)) #False
return (True or (True and False)) #True and so on

Bootstrap5 dropped jQuery
Django Custom User models:
AbstractUser: Allows to inherit from abstract user class and lets you add certain fields that are not built in
AbstractBaseUser:

Django Extensions: python manage.py shell_plus lets us practice ORM queries so we can practice and see what our queries are doing.
Crispy Forms module lets us create more in depth fors

How to branch:
Make sure current git is up to date

Django's kwargs can be used as a context dictionary that we can customize to contain certain fields that we can add to for referencing around the django templates,views and models.



```powershell

git checkout -b branch_name
#-b creates branch
git add .
#add . adds everything modified since last push
git commit .
git push --set-upstream origin branch_name

git branch
#see which branch we are currently on

#switch to branch name before merge using git checkout schedule
git merge branch_name
#after merging we have to add the new git files we merged from the branch to our main app
git add file_name.js#py#html
#commit and push
```

<h4>DS&A:</h4>
Order H when dealing with time complexity refers to the height of the binary tree/BST to find the node. You wouldn't WANT order N of a tree because that means you'd have to go through every node of the tree to find your result, which kind of defeats the purpose.


```python
#create tree structure bottom up
class TreeNode():
    def __init__(self,data, left,right):
        self.data = data
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

#Bottoms Up
#more organized, easier to track left and right
node1 = TreeNode(1, None, None)
node3 = TreeNode(3, None, None)
node2 = TreeNode(2, node1, node3)

node6 = TreeNode(6, None, None)
node9 = TreeNode(9, None, None)
node7 = TreeNode(7, node6, node9)

root = TreeNode(4, node2, node7)

    #        4
    #      /   \
    #     2     7
    #    / \   / \
    #   1   3 6   9

#
#Recursion
#DFS
#Base Case: if root is False
#Recursion Function: if current node exists 
#return .data of current node + recursive left result + recursive right result

def sum(root):
    if root == None:
        return 0
    
    return root.data + sum(root.left) + sum(root.right)
#how to find height
def height(root):
    #based case
    # Check if the binary tree is empty
    if root is None:
        # If TRUE return 0
        return 0 
    # Recursively call height of each node
    leftAns = height(root.left)
    rightAns = height(root.right)
 
    # Return max(leftHeight, rightHeight) at each iteration
    return max(leftAns, rightAns) + 1

```

These are not the same

```python

root.right = self.invertTree(root.left)
root.left = self.invertTree(root.right)
#not the same as
root.right,root.left = self.invertTree(root.left), self.invertTree(root.right)

```

```python
#utility function to find path
  def find_path(self, start_vertex, end_vertex):
    start = [start_vertex]
    seen = {}
    while len(start) > 0:
      current_vertex = start.pop(0)
      seen[current_vertex] = True
      print("Visiting " + current_vertex)
      if current_vertex == end_vertex:
        return True
      else:
        vertices_to_visit = set(self.graph_dict[current_vertex].edges.keys())
        start += [vertex for vertex in vertices_to_visit if vertex not in seen]
    return False

#dfs and bfs for graphs:
def dfs(graph, current_vertex, target_value, visited = None):
  if visited is None:
    visited = []
  visited.append(current_vertex)
  if current_vertex is target_value:
    return visited
  
  for neighbor in graph[current_vertex]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
      path = dfs(graph, neighbor, target_value, visited)
      if path:
        return path
      
def bfs(graph, start_vertex, target_value):
  path = [start_vertex]
  vertex_and_path = [start_vertex, path]
  bfs_queue = [vertex_and_path]
  visited = set()
  while bfs_queue:
    current_vertex, path = bfs_queue.pop(0)
    visited.add(current_vertex)
    for neighbor in graph[current_vertex]:
      if neighbor not in visited:
        if neighbor is target_value:
          return path + [neighbor]
        else:
          bfs_queue.append([neighbor, path + [neighbor]])
```
How-to create a graph from a list of edges. Basically what is happening here is it iterates through each edge first,
then we assign the first vertice as the graph key and 
```python
    graph = {}
    edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[3,5],[5,4],[4,3]]
    for edge in edges:
        graph[edge[0]] = graph.get(edge[0], []) + [edge[1]]
        graph[edge[1]] = graph.get(edge[1], []) + [edge[0]]

```
Fischer-Yates algorithm to find next permutation of an array

```python
	def shuffle(self) -> List[int]:
		ans = self.arr[:]
		for i in range(len(ans)):
			swp_num = random.randrange(i, len(ans))  # Fisher-Yates Algorithm
			ans[i], ans[swp_num] = ans[swp_num], ans[i]
		return an
```

Hash maps are most commonly used with graphs.
